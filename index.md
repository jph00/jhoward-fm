Here's a quick list of a few things I've created (or co-created):

- [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai), which is (AFAIK) the most widely-used deep learning course in the world, and has launched many careers in research, industry, and startups
- [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527), a book, based on the course, which has 5 stars on Amazon. Google's Director of Research, Peter Norvig, says "*The book does an impressive job of covering the key applications of deep learning in computer vision, natural language processing, and tabular data processing, but also covers key topics like data ethics that some other books miss. Altogether, this is one of the best sources for a programmer to become proficient in deep learning.*"
- The [global masks4all movement](http://archive.is/evklI), including leading the [largest evidence review of masks](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118), published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, and becoming the most read paper of all time on preprints.org. I also wrote articles in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/28/masks-all-coronavirus/), [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/why-wear-a-mask-may-be-our-best-weapon-to-stop-coronavirus), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/dont-wear-mask-yourself/610336/), [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/masks-help-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-the-science-is-simple-and-im-one-of-100-experts-urging-governors-to-require-public-mask-wearing-138507), and the [Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/national/why-are-masks-not-yet-mandatory-in-australia-20200708-p55a4k.html), and appeared on most of the national US TV 
- [Kaggle](https://www.wired.com/2011/12/kaggle/), the world's largest data science community, where I was the founding President and Chief Scientist (and reached #1 on the global machine learning competition leaderboard!)
- [Enlitic](https://singularityhub.com/2015/11/11/exponential-medicine-deep-learning-ai-better-than-your-doctor-at-finding-cancer/), the first company to focus on deep learning for medicine, where I raised $18m within 2 years of creating the company
- [Record breaking](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/08/10/141098/small-team-of-ai-coders-beats-googles-code/) deep learning performance on [Dawnbench](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17316010/fast-ai-speed-test-stanford-dawnbench-google-intel), with some of my brilliant students
- The [ULMFiT algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-ulmfit-and-elmo-the-shift-towards-transfer-learning-in-nlp-b5d8e2e3f664), which helped to [crack the code of natural language](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/technology/artificial-intelligence-language.html)
- "[The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that learn](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn)", a talk on TED.com that has received over 2.5m views, now translated into 26 languages
